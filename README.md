# Online-Theater
This project is developed using C# winforms and built in Sql database in visual studio. 
The app basically first allows you to enter the price for each row and then allow user to select from the given rows. 
users enter the row number and enter its price and then it will be booked for them. 
the top header contains the total availble seats in the theater now.

Make sure to modify the connection string in properties>settings.settings before you use it. 
First go to the server explorer which is most probably present on the left side of your visual studio. then inside Data connections
you will see a database name like Database1.mdf 
right click on it and then select properties.
on the right bottom side of visual studio you will see the properties of the Database1.mdf. Copy the connection string and then go to the properties>settings.settings
remove the last value and paste the connection string instead.
